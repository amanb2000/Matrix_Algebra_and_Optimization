    "It is important to use a specifically designed transform matrix $H$ because $H$ is composed of orthonormal discrete Haar wavelet vectors. When images are projected onto the vectors, they tend to be already somewhat sparse. It turns out that images and signals in general can be well-approximated by relatively few (i.e. a sparse set of) wavelets. A randomly selected orthonormal matrix would not necessarily yield an accurate sparse representation. \n",
